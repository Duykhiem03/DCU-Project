                <h4>Northern Cuisine - light and balanced</h4>
                <p>
                    Northern cuisine is not biased towards any particular flavor: sour, spicy, salty, sweet or bitter. It is relatively light and balanced thanks to the subtle combination of many different flavoring ingredients, in which fish sauce, shrimp paste and limes are particularly popular. 
                    Besides, the foods in the region are often less spicy, fatty and sweet, compared to those of other regions in the country though the climate is colder. Northern people tend to consume a fair amount of vegetables and freshwater fishery such as shrimp, squid, crab, fish, clam and other shellfish…. The use of meats such as pork, beef, and chicken were relatively limited in the past.
