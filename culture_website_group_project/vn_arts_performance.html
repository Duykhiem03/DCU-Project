            <h3>Water Puppetry</h3>
            <p>
                Vietnam Water Puppet (one of the most indigenous cultural traits of Vietnam) goes along with history of  over 4000 years. The traditional form of art was created when local working on the rice field, 
                first it entertained the farmers then it was performed on the stages for guests during the festival. This performance was conserved through generations until today.
                Unlike the shadow puppetry found in other Asian countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, the puppet shows held throughout Vietnam take place over a waist-deep pool of water. 
                A water puppet show will not only demonstrate for the outstanding performance but also the unique, long-established culture, customs of the S-shaped country.

                        It is a set of stone slabs of different sizes and shapes used to make percussive melodies. The tools to knock on the surface of the stone and the herb are also made of green stone. 
                        It requires skills to fashion the stones into a shape where they would produce a melodious sound. For some ethnic groups in Central Highlands, the stone slabs are sacred and preserved as family treasures played during grand ceremonies for the gods. Other groups use the stone for setting crop protection devices.
