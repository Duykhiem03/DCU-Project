                Vietnam is in South-East Asia, which forms an 'S' shape as it snakes down the South China Sea from north to south. 
                This coastline is one of the main touristic attractions of the country, with the white sandy beaches of Phan Thiet, Nha Trang, Con Dao, 
                and Phu Quoc in the South, to the charming and historical Lang Co, Danang, and Hoi An in the Central area.

                There are some major cities in Vietnam. One of them is the country's capital, Hanoi, located in the northern part of Vietnam, which has a population of approximately 7 million. 
                The capital is the second biggest city in Vietnam after Ho Chi Minh City, in South Vietnam, which has 12.7 million inhabitants and is considered the economic heart of Vietnam.

        <h3>Cultural Diversity</h3>
        <p class="center-content">
            Vietnam has 54 ethnic groups living across the country. Each ethnic group has its own cultural identities, thus, the Vietnamese culture has both diversity and unity.<br>
            Apart from the typical Viet-Muong culture, there are other cultural groups like Tay-Nung, Thai, Cham, Hoa-Ngai, Mon-Khmer, Mong-Dao, and especially the groups in the Central Highlands that still maintain fairly diverse 
            and comprehensive traditions of a purely agricultural society that is closely attached to forests and mountains. One distinctive feature of highland ethnic minority groups in Vietnam is that they are colorfully attired whether at home, 
            in the farm, traveling or in their home town.

        <h3>Cultural Influence</h3>
        <p class="center-content">
            Vietnamese Culture is one of the oldest culture in the World which has undergone changes almost four thousands of years. It can be said that there were three layers of culture overlapping each other during the history of Vietnam: local culture, the culture that mixed with those of China and other countries in the region, 
            and the culture that interacted with Western culture. The most prominent feature of the Vietnamese culture is that it was not assimilated by foreign cultures thanks to the strong local cultural foundations. On the contrary, it was able to utilize and localize those from abroad to enrich the national culture. 
            Moreover, the Vietnamese national culture emerged from a specific living environment: a tropical country with many rivers and the confluence of great cultures.
