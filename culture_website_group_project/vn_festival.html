            <h3>Overview of a festival</h3>
            <p>
                Tet Holiday, more commonly known by its shortened name Tet, is the most important and popular holiday and festival in Vietnam. 
                It is the Vietnamese New Year marking the arrival of spring based on the Lunar calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vietnamese people consider Tet Holiday the best occasion for family members to return home and get together. During Tet, Vietnamese spend time shopping for the New Year and going to Pagodas and Temples. The items of shopping range from food to clothing to decorations for the house. 
                The Vietnamese believe that Tet Holiday is an occasion to enjoy life after a full hard-working year. Thus people forget their struggles and focus on making the celebration as festive as possible. 
                With high regard, Tet is unique, with distinctive colors and flavors of truly celebrating the new year.

                    <h5>Chung Cake</h5>
                    <p>
                        An important component of the celebrations is Banh Chung (sticky square cake). It is a food that they make from glutinous rice, mung bean, and pork, added with many other ingredients. 
                        It is covered by green leaves and symbolizes the Earth, invented by prince Lang Lieu from the Hung King dynasty.

                    <p>
                        It is the main staple food for the Tết holiday. It has many forms: Xoi Lac (sticky rice with peanuts), Xoi Đo Xanh (sticky rice with mung bean), Xoi Gac (sticky rice with special “gac” fruit). 
                        Among these types, Xoi gac is the favorite the most people because of its special red color - which symbolizes luck and new achievement for the New Year.

                        Mut Tet (Tet Sugar-coated fruit) is not a food to serve in a meal during the Tet holiday. It's more like a snack to welcome guests in this special period. 
                        This once-in-year mix of snacks is very large in variety, with so many tastes: ginger, carrot, coconut, pineapple, pumpkin, lotus seed, star fruit, etc.

            <h5>Giving lucky money</h5>
            <p>
                The first day of the Tet holiday is for the nuclear family. Children receive a red envelope containing money from their elders. This tradition is called “mung tuoi” (happy new age) in the north and “lì xì” in the south. 
                Usually, children wear their new clothes and give their elders the traditional Tet greetings before receiving the money.

            <h5>Decoration</h5>
            <p>
                At Tet, we decorate every house with “hoa mai” - Ochna integerrima (in the central and southern parts of Vietnam) or “hoa đao” - cherry blossom (in the northern part of Vietnam) or “hoa ban” (in mountain areas). 
                In the north or central, the kumquat tree is a popular decoration for the living room during Tet. Its bright orange-colored fruits represent the fertility and fruitfulness that the family hopes for in the coming year.

        <div class="col-2-3">
            <h5>"Xong nha"</h5>
            <p>
                People call the act of being the first person to enter the home on Tet Holiday “xong dat, xong nha or dap dat”, which is one of the most important rituals during Tết.<br>
                According to Vietnamese tradition, if good things come to the family on the first day of the lunar New Year, the following year will also be full of blessings. 
                Usually, a person of good temper, morality, and success will be a lucky sign for the host family.
