            <h1>Hi, we are EduSimply</h1>
            <p>
                We are group of young and inspiring developers who have backgrounds in areas such as computing,
                teaching, psychology, and human development.

                <h4>What is The Product?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The product we decided on as a group is an educational virtual assistance model with Generative
                        AI.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our educational GenAI would operate similarly to other Generative AIs. But what sets our GenAI
                        apart is its focus on efficiency in education.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Often when using GenAI people find that it either gives them information outside of the parameters
                    that they were hoping for, additionally we found that students had a hard time finding one all
                    encompassing AI model that actually aided them in their education.
                    So we came up with an AI module that solves both of these problems EduSimply.

                <h4>Why did we decide to build this app?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We as a group found a lack of optimisation regarding education even though 
                        “Students claim that GenAI makes learning easier, as they help students manage and organise their work more efficiently”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Schools and colleges often disregard the benefits of GenAI in an attempt to ensure the student does not misuse GenAI. 
                        However, for students that want to genuinely educate themselves through the efficient and effective route of AI, there are not any simple AI-encompassing things for their educational needs.
