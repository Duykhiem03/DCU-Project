			Maslenitsa is a traditional Slavic holiday celebrated during the week before Great Lent, preceding the Orthodox Great Fast. The celebration of Maslenitsa typically falls in February or March, depending on the calendar.
			<br>
			<br>
			The main feature of Maslenitsa is the abundant feasting on pancakes. Pancakes symbolize the sun and the arrival of spring, and their round shape is associated with the sun disc. During this period, many families prepare pancakes of various kinds: thin, thick, with various fillings and additives.
			<br>
			<br>
			An important part of Maslenitsa celebrations is various games, folk festivities, and entertainment. Numerous folk festivities and Maslenitsa fairs are held during this time, where one can buy various craft items and treats.
			<br>
			<br>
			A significant conclusion to Maslenitsa is the tradition of burning the effigy, also known as "Maslenitsa" or "Wide Maslenitsa." This ritual symbolizes bidding farewell to winter and welcoming spring.
